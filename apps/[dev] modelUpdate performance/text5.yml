        ### ModelUpdate performance test app


        This application uses custom `@retool/performance/modelUpdate` event to
        record time it takes to run modelUpdate for certain components.
        Integration spec interacts with some of the components, time it takes to
        update the model is recorded, aggregated, and assumptions are run on it.


        Current expectation is that all v2 components can propagate model
        updates within 16ms in viewer mode, and within 32 ms in editor mode.
